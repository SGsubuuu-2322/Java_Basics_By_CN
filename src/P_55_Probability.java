//An urn contains 8 balls : 4 red , 2 blue and 2 green. Now n balls are drawn out of the urn. 
//Calculate the probability that out of n drawn balls exactly x balls are red.
//Find your answer multiplied by 100 and return the integer part.
//All required values for computation will be in integer range.
//x is always less than equal to 4 and x is always less than equal to n.
//Input format :
//Two spaced integers : n and x
//Output format :
//Integer part of (Probability * 100). 
//Sample Input 1 :
//3 1
//Sample Output 1:
//42
